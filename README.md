I am Kamal Achalhi, i am actually doing an intership discovery in Neuroscience Institut of Timone (Marseille, France).
I am a master student in signal and image processing ("Master 1 TSI (Aix-Marseille University)). The topic of my intership is initiation to automatic fetal and neotal MRI segmentation. 
I expect to improve my programming level on python. I want to see research world more closely to mature my professional project.
